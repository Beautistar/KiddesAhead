Repeat after me 
•	Alphabet- doesn’t work well- I have given incorrect answers and it says I am right  
•	Greetings- well done doesn’t work
•	Weather- should be, sun, rain, cloud, snow, windy, storm, cold
•	Colours- great 
•	When exciting the page to back to the home page the sound for the previous screen still repeats when excited on the home page 
•	Clothing- doesn’t work well (pants- it should be trousers), shirt accepts t-shirt,  
•	Some numbers don’t match image 


Flashcard:
•	The pause button only mutes the sounds, please note the flashcard images don’t pause

•	Numbers are not showing in order anymore 
•	Alphabet is not showing in order anymore 
•	100 has no image or audio 
•	When selecting all for flashcards, please can the well-done page appear once it has been completed.       
•	Touch and speak- some of the images are very small and its unclear what the image is, is it possible when they select it this enlarges??? 
•	Push notification, regarding completing the set hours for the week 
•	Does this reset every week???? 
•	Hand looks like an arm 
•	 Finger- image should be just a finger not fingers 
•	Body parts could have the lion pointing the body parts on his body (belly bottom, tommy, back bottom and shoulder) this will make the images more child friendly 
•	Numbers not in order 
•	Numbers are mixed up 
•	Remove toilet tissue
